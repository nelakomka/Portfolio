            <img src="./assets/React/ExerciseReact.gif" alt="React Exercise" />
            <h5>Exercise</h5>
            <p>
              A school project where I had to design and develop a website for
              exercises.
            </p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, ReactJS</p>
            <p>
              A problem I encountered is having certain exercises be a specific
              color which I solved by splitting it up into components.
            </p>
            <p>The design was dictated since it is a school project.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="project">
            <img src="./assets/React/Menu.gif" alt="React Menu" />
            <h5>Menu</h5>
            <p>A school project where I had to program a menu.</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, ReactJS</p>
            <p>The design was dictated since it is a school project.</p>

              <img src="./assets/React/Candels.gif" alt="Candels" />
            </a>
            <h5>Candels</h5>
            <p>
              A school team project where I redesigned and developed a website
              that sells candles.
            </p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, ReactJS</p>
            <p>
              A problem encountered was macking the cart add up which I solved
              by using props and a count.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design was inspired bu other websites that sells candels or
              other products. The dark green is a great and inviting color to
              see. The "Add to Cart" buttons are made big for better UX and to
              stimulate people to click. "Out of Stock" items are darkened and
              have a label for better UX. Hovers and all other navigations are
              for better UX too.

              A school project where I took care of coding the profile page with
              an already developed design.

              A problem encountered was diplaying the social media images
              properly which I solved by researching CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design was dictated by a designer since it is a school
              project.

            <p>
              The design was dictated since it is a school project except the

              A school project where I designed a high functioning prototype for
              a website that sells cats and dogs.

            <p>Figma</p>
            <p>
              A problem encountered was developing the design and prototype
              which I solved by having people use the prototype and give me
              feedback.

              A problem encountered was adding a new task which I solved by
              doing so with a span and DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              When developing a design I wanted something with a candy like
              feel. The baby blue and pink work well to achieve that. The actual
              To-Do being a square is for easier adaptive.

            <h5>Flash Cards</h5>
            <p>A school project where I designed a flash card app.</p>
            <p>Figma</p>
            <p>
              A problem encountered was not overwhelming the design with too
              many colors which I solved by restricting it to 3-4 colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a studying type of app such as this flashcard app I wanted to
              keep it simple and minimal with colors. Still, some clor pop is
              needed so I made the action buttons with color.
